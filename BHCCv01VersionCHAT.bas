'PROGRAM - "BIBLICAL HEBREW CALENDAR CREATOR" - GETS DATA FILE RECORDS, CONVERTS THIS INFORMATION TO PROGRAM-USABLE DATA & CREATES THE HEBREW CALENDAR OF THE BIBLE ACCORDING TO THE HEBREW YEAR AND MONTH
'WHAT THE BIBLICAL HEBREW CALENDAR CREATOR (BHCC) PROGRAM DOES:
'   - THE BHCC RE-CREATES THE HEBREW CALENDAR AS IT IS DESCRIBED IN THE BIBLE.  IT ACCOMPLISHES THIS THROUGH THE USE OF A DATA FILE WHICH
'     CONTAINS THE REQUIRED INFORMATION ON MOON PHASES, GREGORIAN-CALCULATION, JULIAN-DAY TRACKING, VERNAL EQUINOX, ETC.
'   - THE PROGRAM DISPLAYS ONE HEBREW MONTH AT A TIME, WITH OPTION TO DISPLAY ANY SINGLE MONTH OF THE YEAR THAT HAS BEEN CHOSEN BY THE USER.
'   - THE BEGINNING OF EACH NEW HEBREW MONTH IN THE BIBLE WAS BASED ON THE TIMING OF THE NEW MOON PHASE (NO VISIBLE MOONLIGHT) OF THE MOON.
'     - THE HEBREWS WERE INSTRUCTED TO BEGIN EACH NEW MONTH WHEN THEY COULD SEE THE FIRST "SLIVER" OF MOONLIGHT AFTER THE NO-LIGHT NEW MOON.
'     - THIS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A PROBLEM BECAUSE RE-CREATIONS OF THE HEBREW CALENDAR HAVE NOT BEEN CONSTRUCTED IN A WAY THAT PROPERLY
'       ACCOUNTS FOR THIS SLIVER-OF-LIGHT DELAY.  WITHOUT AN ACCURATE CALENDAR, ACCURATELY CALCULATING THE TIMING OF BIBLICAL EVENTS IS NOT POSSIBLE.
'     - BHCC ORIGINALLY ADDRESSED THIS PROBLEM BY ENABLING THE USER TO ASSIGN THE AMOUNT OF DELAY AFTER THE NEW MOON, WHILE AWAITING A VISIBLE
'       SLIVER TO APPEAR, FROM 0 DEGREES OF EXTRA MOON PHASE (MOON AT 180 DEGREES - NO MOONLIGHT) TO 17 DEGREES OF EXTRA MOON PHASE (MOON AT 163
'       DEGREES - A VERY LARGE SLIVER FOR VIEWING PURPOSES).  THE AMOUNT OF DELAY WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE THE BEST BEST AND MOST CONSISTENT OPTION
'       FOR THE CALENDAR IS 9 DEGREES OF EXTRA MOON PHASE (MOON AT 171 DEGREES - A VERY SLIGHT BUT VIEWABLE SLIVER).  THIS IS THE SETTING USED IN
'       THE PROGRAM FOR YEARS FROM THE EXODUS TO THE RE-CREATION AT THE END OF GOD'S SEVENTH MILLENNIUM.  OUTSIDE OF THIS PERIOD, 0 DEGREES IS THE
'       SETTING USED BECAUSE GOD ADMINISTERS HIS CALENDAR AT THESE TIMES, AND HE DOESN'T NEED TO SEE A MOON-CRESCENT.
'   - WHICH NEW MOON WOULD BEGIN THE NEW HEBREW YEAR WAS BASED ON THE TIMING OF THE SPRING BARLEY HARVEST.  THIS IS CALCULATED USING THE NEW MOON
'     WHICH APPEARS AT THE TIME CLOSEST TO THE VERNAL EQUINOX, EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER IT.
'   - BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW DAYS MORE THAN 12 NEW MOONS IN A SOLAR YEAR, EVERY THIRD YEAR OR SO THE HEBREW CALENDAR'S NORMAL 12 MONTHS ARE
'     AUGMENTED WITH A 13TH LEAP MONTH.
'   - WHEN THE DESIGNATED HEBREW-MONTH CALENDAR-DISPLAY HAS BEEN GENERATED, IT IS OVERLAID WITH THE CORRESPONDING GREGORIAN CALENDAR-DAYS.
'   - TO FACILITATE THE CALCULATION OF TIME INTERVALS BETWEEN CALENDAR-DAYS, THE JULIAN DAY-COUNT IS ALSO TRACKED AND DISPLAYED.
'   - BECAUSE THE START (AND END) OF EACH NEW HEBREW DAY IS AT SUNSET, AND CAN VARY BY HOURS FROM SUMMER TO WINTER, THE HEBREW DAYS CAN NOT
'     BE STRICTLY ALIGNED WITH GREGORIAN DAYS.  TO OVERCOME THIS, THE GREGORIAN START-OF-DAY AT MIDNIGHT, DIVIDES THE HEBREW DAY INTO TWO
'     PARTS, FROM SUNSET TO MIDNIGHT AND FROM MIDNIGHT TO THE NEXT SUNSET.  TO ACHIEVE A COHERENT CALENDAR DISPLAY, THE SUNSET START OF THE
'     HEBREW DAY ALWAYS LOCATES AT THE SAME DISTANCE (52 PIXELS) BEFORE MIDNIGHT (1ST PART OF THE HEBREW DAY, REPRESENTING ABOUT 1/4 OF THE HEBREW
'     DAY), AND THE SUNSET END OF THE HEBREW DAY ALWAYS LOCATES AT THE SAME DISTANCE (147 PIXELS) AFTER MIDNIGHT (2ND PART OF THE HEBREW DAY,
'     REPRESENTING ABOUT 3/4 OF THE HEBREW DAY).  DUE TO VARIATION IN SOLAR TIMING, THESE TWO HEBREW-DAY PARTS EACH REPRESENT VARYING PORTIONS OF
'     THE 24-HOUR DAY AS THE YEAR MOVES THROUGH THE SEASONS, BUT TOGETHER ALWAYS REPRESENT ONE FULL 24 HOUR DAY.  FORMULAS WERE DERIVED TO
'     ACCOMMODATE THESE LENGTH-OF-TIME VARIATIONS IN ORDER TO CORRECTLY PLACE (AT THE CORRECT PIXEL RELATIVE TO MIDNIGHT) THE NEW MOON ICON
'     (AND THE OTHER 3 MOON PHASE ICONS), AS WELL AS THE DELAYED SLIVER-MOON ICON AND THE SUNRISE LOCATION.
